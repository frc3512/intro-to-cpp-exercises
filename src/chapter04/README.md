##NameValuePairs
In Chapter 4, Exercise 19, the exercise calls for you, the programmer, to create a program that puts names and values into a vector, and then Cout those names and values. It asks that when you input "NoName 0" to terminate input, don't output NoName 0. When displaying the names and values, follow the exercise, meaning, cout as (Name,Value). When the program detects that there are two names that are the same, you are meant to terminate the program and send out an error message. Make sure you throw and catch an exception, and that the exception is as follows, "One name is entered twice." Lastly the names and Valuse you need to put in are Kyle 18, Matthew 78, Jin 56, Ivy 43, and Gabriel 12.

For these two, since they're both very similar, we'll cover what you need to know right here. First, the book details that you need to motify the programs so that when you enter either an integer or name then it will print out the corresponding name or integer. Make sure that it only does this, don't print all the names/integers, only the ones you search for. Search for them in the order you input them, so Kyle or 18, Matthew or 78, etc. The exercise tells you to output either, "name not found," or, "score not found." Do this by throwing and catching an exceptions of name or score not found.
