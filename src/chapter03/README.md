## Unspecified Prompts
Many exercises ask that prompts be directed to the user so he/she can enter in values to store in variables. If no specific phrase is specified in the textbook instructions or in this markdown file, the student can phrase the prompt in any way he/she prefers (as long as the prompt makes sense in context, of course)
