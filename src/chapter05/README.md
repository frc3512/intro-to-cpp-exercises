## FixCelsiustoKelvin 
In this exercise it asks you to fix the broken Celsius to Kelvin program. When it's fixed you need to run the program, which means you need to input a celsius temperature. Use 45.7 as the input temperature. 

## AbsoluteZero
This program requests that the user use the same program as before to calculate the conversion of Celsius to Kelvin. This exercise in perticular details that the absolute zero for Celsius is -273.15. It asks that whenever an input lower that that is inputed, that an error be outputed. This error should go as follows: "Temperature below absolute zero!" Don't input a numbers that will cause the program to run correctly, only ones that are below -273.15. 

## KelvintoCelsius
Exercise 5 tells you to change to program from before, Celsius to Kelvin, to convert Kelvin to Celsius. The Kelvin temperature that you need to input for the program is 345. 

## QuadraticEquations
Exercise 7 talks about solving quadratic equations. Hopefully you know ways to solve them, If not speak with one of your fellow software members or a teacher. Now, knowing how to solve said equations, have your program use 1,3, and 2 as the a,b, and c variables. Then use 2,4, and -2 as the a,b, and c as the second run through. Have your program ask for an input, a,b, and c, and then calculate the roots for that equation. The second set won't have any roots. make sure that a message is outputed. This message should read as follows: "No roots!." When outputting the roots, have the output message be: "'root 1' and 'root 2' are the roots of this problem." Obvioulsy, don't use 'root 1' and 'root 2' use what the roots actually are!

## NthInteger
For exercise 8, the numbers you need to put into the vector are 24, 25, 63, and 78. have the final output be formatted as it is in the book. Then input to find the sum of the first 3 integers. Do still terminate the input with the '|' character. Also, please format your prompts for inputs exactly like the book. 

## NthIntWthError
In this exercise, modify your previous program to have and error ouput when the sum of the numbers can't be an integer. Your error message should read: "Cannot be represented as an int." Don't have the prorgram out put the sum of the numbers, just the initial prompts, and the error. The numbers you need to input for this program are: 22 15 3.67. Then for the first input, input 3 again. 

## Differences 
Differences tasks you with changing your program from the NthInteger exercise to work with doubles. It also tasks you with creating another double vector, this one stores the difference between the second and first numbers in the vector, and the fourth and the third, and so on. Prompt the use to unput the number they want of sums and to put in some numbers. Instead of prompting for integers, this time have the prompt read: "Please enter some numbers (press'|' to stop):" The numbers you will input will be 2.5, 8, 8, 12.45. Then for the prompt of how many numbers to sum, say 3 once more.
