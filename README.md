## How to Find the Problems
At the end of each of the chapters you will find pages with an orange background and they have excercises that correspond to the name of the function that was written inside of the Exercise.cpp file. The title of where the problems are located is labeled "Exercises" and will be found directly under the title.

## "Try This" problems
Exercise 1 asks to complete all the "Try This" problems mentioned in Chapter 3 and above. The "Try This" problems are found during the chapter compared to the end of it. They are listed in Test.cpp as Exercise1A, Exercise1B, etc. Some of the problems instruct getting the base example program to run before adding more to it. Students are encouraged to do this, but the tests will only check for the completed product of each problem.

## How to Enter Code for These Problems
Inside of the src folder each of the chapters are neatly located. Inside of the Excercise.cpp file you will see
functions with a name signifying each of the problems characteristics. In the functions curly brackets you will enter code to solve the problems, not including int main or the include statements. In each of these problems if they require a cin to enter something, there will be a folder with all the inputs that are going to be inputted for the respective problem.

## How to Check the Problems
To run these problems you type "make" inside of the terminal for the selected project and if it returns any warnings that means there are problems in your code. To see what the warnings are referencing to, you can see the excercise name inside of the warnings and that will direct you to the problem that gave you an error.
